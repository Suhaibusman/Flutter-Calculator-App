# ðŸŒ± goGreen

With **goGreen**, you can make your profile look like you've been hard at work... even if you haven't. 
NodeJs script to make commits to the past (or the future) to go green on GitHub.

## About

**goGreen** helps you create commits on your GitHub profile for any date in the past. Whether you want to fill up your contribution graph or even make cool patterns and artwork.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to bring your contribution graph to life:

1. **Clone this repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fenrir2608/goGreen.git
cd goGreen
```
3. **Set up your project**
Initialize a new Node.js project:
```bash
npm init -y
  ```
3. **Install the required npm modules**
You'll need a few modules to get everything running smoothly. Install them all with:
  ```bash
  npm install moment simple-git random
  ```
4. **Create your commit script**
- Create a JavaScript file to manage your commits.
- Create a JSON file to store all the commit timestamp data.

## Room for Improvement

So, you've got the basics down. What's next?

- **Custom Patterns:** Experiment with different patterns on your contribution graph. Maybe spell out your name or create some cool designs.
- **Density Control:** Play around with the number of commits per day to adjust the shades of green.
- **Input Strings:** Convert input strings to X-Y mapped contributions.
